## Summary

This repo contains:
 * An [install_ros.sh](install_ros.sh) script that installs
     [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) **with Python 3
     support**.  The install contains not just the `desktop_full`
     suite of ROS but also the
     [rosbridge_suite](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite)
     package which provides a JSON API to ROS for webapps
     like [WebViz](https://webviz.io/).  This script might 
     be useful outside of this project.
 * A Docker image (published as `psegs/ext-ros-test` that demonstrates
     how to use and test the install.
